		<p><strong>Project Statement</strong></p>
		<p>Through the technological advances in the past century, more and more parts of our daily life is shifting from the real world to the digital world. Objects like newspapers, books, and photographs have all been given a digital form that can be easily viewed and shared at the click of a mouse. These objects, once physical entities, are now losing their material form, "[their] presence in time and space, [their] unique existence at the place where it happens to be" (Benjamin, 3) in order to live up to the rapid pace of our technology filled lifestyles. These objects are losing what Walter Benjamin calls "the aura of the work of art". In the past, art something that was drawn or painted on a canvas at some place and some time. Once completed, the piece of art was an unique object in the world. As we enter the digital age, art can now be easily reproduced, either through photographs of unique artworks, or artworks drawn on a computer screen and saved digitally as a combination of binary numbers. Despite losing some of its uniqueness, art can now be easily distributed and shared for all to view.</p>
		<p>I believe that the technological age has definitely changed our perception of art. To demonstrate this, our project consists of a labyrinth of images and inspirational quotes, linked together using hypertext. Some of the images correctly depict the original source of the quote while others are misattributed. This is to mirror the idea that digital forms of art and media have lost its uniqueness when viewed online since it no longer has an attributed time and place much like how the misattributed quotes can be posted an infinite amount of different times on the Internet.</p>
		<p>Hypertext serves as a way to link different things together through words as well as images, videos, or sounds. Humans are able to click on elements on webpages to view other related pages of their choice. At first glance, a user may have this preconception that the quotes are directly said by the displayed character since we chose combinations that would seem believable. As the user traverses through the pages, they soon realize that most quotes actually have no direct connection to the character. This is done to question the idea of online authorship - can we believe everything on the Internet to be true or factual? Our project randomly links words to other pages, but if I were to relink the pages, I would want the chosen word or image to be related to the next page. It was interesting how we were to make a labyrinth or maze - something that has a definite beginning and end - using hypertext - something that has no endpoints. The Internet complements the real world as a way to connect people around the world through digital media.</p>
