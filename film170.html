				<h2><a href="http://people.ucsc.edu/~mimlowe/project1/one.html">Labyrinth</a></h2>
				<p>October 7, 2015</p>
				<p><strong>Project Statement</strong></p>
				<p>Through the technological advances in the past century, more and more parts of our daily life is shifting from the real world to the digital world. Objects like newspapers, books, and photographs have all been given a digital form that can be easily viewed and shared at the click of a mouse. These objects, once physical entities, are now losing their material form, "[their] presence in time and space, [their] unique existence at the place where it happens to be" (Benjamin, 3) in order to live up to the rapid pace of our technology filled lifestyles. These objects are losing what Walter Benjamin calls "the aura of the work of art". In the past, art something that was drawn or painted on a canvas at some place and some time. Once completed, the piece of art was an unique object in the world. As we enter the digital age, art can now be easily reproduced, either through photographs of unique artworks, or artworks drawn on a computer screen and saved digitally as a combination of binary numbers. Despite losing some of its uniqueness, art can now be easily distributed and shared for all to view.</p>
				<p>I believe that the technological age has definitely changed our perception of art. To demonstrate this, our project consists of a labyrinth of images and inspirational quotes, linked together using hypertext. Some of the images correctly depict the original source of the quote while others are misattributed. This is to mirror the idea that digital forms of art and media have lost its uniqueness when viewed online since it no longer has an attributed time and place much like how the misattributed quotes can be posted an infinite amount of different times on the Internet.</p>
				<p>Hypertext serves as a way to link different things together through words as well as images, videos, or sounds. Humans are able to click on elements on webpages to view other related pages of their choice. At first glance, a user may have this preconception that the quotes are directly said by the displayed character since we chose combinations that would seem believable. As the user traverses through the pages, they soon realize that most quotes actually have no direct connection to the character. This is done to question the idea of online authorship - can we believe everything on the Internet to be true or factual? Our project randomly links words to other pages, but if I were to relink the pages, I would want the chosen word or image to be related to the next page. It was interesting how we were to make a labyrinth or maze - something that has a definite beginning and end - using hypertext - something that has no endpoints. The Internet complements the real world as a way to connect people around the world through digital media.</p>

				<h2>Mapping</h2>
				<p>October 14, 2015</p>
				<p><strong>Project Statement</strong></p>
				<p>There are multiple ways to display digital media works on the web. One could display his or her work in a linear fashion, making use of HTML drop down selection menus or just plain text lists displayed on a page. However, those formats lack in visual presentation of work and promote a sense of linearity when users are looking at the page. In order to create a display scheme that promotes non-linearity while maintaining hypertexual links to other digital media works, I designed and prototyped a display wheel that shows a preview of the project within the circle. Users are able to click on these circles in any order, which loads the detailed description and links in a box below. The graphics are purely done with HTML divs with CSS formatting. A JavaScript function brings the page to life by changing the CSS to animate the display. The bottom most circle will be the current project being viewed.</p>
				<p>Why did I choose to make a wheel? Circular objects give a sense of non-linearity because there's no real beginning and end. A user can choose and view the projects that interest them the most. Furthermore, circles give this feeling of connectivity - things that are positioned on the border of the circle are connected in some way.</p>
				<p>Below I have some pictures of hand drawn prototypes. With a bit of calculations, I'm able to position the circles relative to the circle so that all elements rotate simultaneously. Currently, the text below the preview wheel does not update dynamically based on which circle the user chooses; there are plans to fix this issue in the following weeks. Additionally, future iterations of this display wheel may include better formatting of the text as well as moving the title of the work into the center of the display wheel.</p>

				<h2><a href="film170/processing.html">Processing</a></h2>
				<p>October 21, 2015</p>
				<p><strong>Project Statement</strong></p>
				<p>On the web, there are many ways that text can be viewed. News sites like ESPN or online encyclopedias like Wikipedia display the text in article form which is just a block of text. Other forms of text may include infographics which combine text and graphical data or text paired with videos to enhance the user experience. For this project, I created a simple interactive page that displays a nursury rhyme we all learned as children - Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. Taking this text, I wanted to bring the text to life without the aid of images or video. Since the poem is literally about shining stars, I thought to create a page that had blinking text to simulate looking at bright stars in the night sky. The first interation had four lines of text that faded in and out; however, it did not look natural for there to only be four elements representing shining stars, so I broke down the text further into ten segments to add more "star" elements to the page. As for placement, random locations were generated each time a star "faded away" to give a sense that there are a lot more than ten stars in the sky (which is supposed to simulate the billions of stars in the universe). With the main display completed, a problem I ran into was that it was difficult to follow along with the text since the sections were given a random position on the screen. To make it easier to read the text in the order it is intended, one phrase of the poem is highlighted in yellow at one time. The user can click anywhere on the page to highlight and easily read the next segment of text without feeling lost. Overall, I took the text of a simple poem and organized in such a way that the text itself had both texual and visual meanings.</p>

				<h2><a href="film170/ghostmachine/mickey.html">Ghost in the Machine</a></h2>
				<p>October 28, 2015</p>
				<p><strong>Project Statement</strong></p>
				<p>At the turn of the 19th century, cinema and film became a widespread form of entertainment - it was able to capture real time and display that segment of time over and over. Mary Ann Doane writes about how cinema has changed the way humans perceive time for not only the present but also the future. Prior to film, life events were documented as static images or plain text. By shifting from those mediums toward the medium of film where people can view and relive any recorded moment, time seems to become timeless since people of the future can always view events of the past.</p>
				<p>I think the most interesting thing to compare between different cinematic entities is how the evolution of technology shaped cinema in different periods of time. Mickey Mouse is one of the most iconic cartoon characters in the world. For those that were born in previous generations and grew up with Mickey Mouse in their childhood, they still have access to the earliest cartoon films from 1928 where Mickey is a black and white 2 dimensional character on an old TV screen since those films were created and retained in a form that can still be viewed today. For those that were born in the 21st century, we have grown to love the brightly colored 3 dimensional model of Mickey on a high definition screen. The technology advancements in animation tools and television sets has changed the appearance of the character, but even with over 80 years of history, the feeling we get from watching Mickey cartoons is the same. Just based on the characteristics of the cartoon, we are able to periodize the character since we know what kind of technology existed in the early 20th century, mid 20th century, and 21st century.</p>

				<h2><a href="film170/animation/animation.html">Animation</a></h2>
				<p>November 17, 2015</p>
				<p><strong>Project Statement</strong></p>
				<p>While beginning this animation project, I found it quite difficult to choose an object to animate. I wanted to choose an object that had great significance in my everyday life. We live in a world today where technology is so vast and advanced that there are far too many objects that I consider to be important enough that it would be difficult to live without. Laying in bed one night, I decided that I would use my cellphone as the object or subject for animation.</p>
				<p>Despite the fact that my smartphone has the ability to take pictures, it can't take a picture of itself, so I had to use a regular camera to take a picture of myself holding the phone. Using that picture, I added some filters using GIMP, a free image editing software, to make the image look more cartoon-like. With some basic layer duplication and manipulation, I made the phone screen display the image, which displays a phone with the image, and so on, giving the illusion that the image had infinite depth. Animating this image took advantage of CSS3 animations which could be called from a JavaScript script. Currently, the animation only works in Chrome and other browsers with webkit-animation support.</p>
				<p>This project was mainly inspired by infinite GIFs that people post to the internet. I wanted to portray the idea that technology, such as smartphones, are such an integral part of our life that what's shown on the screen is almost the same as reality. When we wake up in the morning, looking at live feeds such as Twitter or news sites like Reddit give us the most up to date information about the world we live in, even if the event that occurred is not one that is local. The virtual world displayed on a phone or computer screen is just an extension of the real world. Sometimes we are so engrossed by technology that we forgo real life interactions for virtual interactions with others. This animation aims to show that the real world and the virtual world are seamlessly linked with one another.</p>

				<h2>Mapping Revamped</a></h2>
				<p>December 3, 2015</p>
				<p><strong>Project Statement</strong></p>
				<p>As I'm a huge fan of interactive web pages, I decided to update the website to create a greater sense of immersion for users visiting the site. I did this through the use of JavaScript and CSS code that adds interactivity to the page. Before, the text was shown all on one page, with no user interactivity. Now the user can choose these spheres at the top in any order they wish to view different subpages.</p>
				<p>Since I have very little artistic talent in terms of drawing, the six circles at the top are currently the different colors on the color wheel. Initially, I planned further updates to this page that would include icons that give the user a sense of what may be on the page once they click on it. However, I actually found that the simplicity of colored circles adds a sense of mystery to the page. By not showing a preview of the project in the center of the circular object, the user can freely pick any one of the six to begin at.  Additionally, I designed the page so that the text is surrounded by a rounded border box that matches the color of the wheel. The circle is attached to the box to give a sense of unity on the page.</p>
				<p>Overall, I'm quite happy with how this project turned out in the end. Adding user interactivity to web pages definitely brings it to life and the design choice to use circles gives a sense that all the entities are somehow connected in a way. This is especially true for things on the Internet. Not only are the media entities connected on the page, but people around the world are connected through the technology we have today.</p>
