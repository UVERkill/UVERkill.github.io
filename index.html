			<div>
				<p>Last Edited: Sept 14, 2015</p>
				<p>I'm Vincent Chen, a 4th year (2nd year transfer) Computer Science: Game Design major at the University of California, Santa Cruz. If I were to choose a few words to describe myself, I'd consider myself an easy going yet competitive and ambitious individual.</p>
				<p>In 2009, my uncle gifted me a book on introductory Java and after a few weeks of making colorful shapes appear in a canvas or creating a functional BrickOut game, I found great joy in programming. Since I was a kid, I enjoyed PC gaming in my free time. Combining my two passions, I decided that my dream would be to work with others to develop creative and fun games for people of all ages around the world to enjoy.</p>
				<p>I'm a huge fan of League of Legends. I began playing in season 1 with a group of close friends who introduced me to the MOBA genre. As I am an incredibly competitive person, I've reached some of the higher ranks in the past few seasons and I keep up with the professional League of Legends scene. My favorite team has been and will always be TSM, the team that sparked my ongoing interest in the game.</p>
				<p>When I'm relaxing or doing work, I often listen to a variety of music, most of which can be found on YouTube. When I'm gaming or crunching out code, I keep upbeat electronic music from Monstercat, NoCopyrightSounds, and Nexus Network on in the background. When I'm in the mood for chill or relaxing music, I find songs from Liquicity and Relaxdaily.</p>
				<p>I'm determined to gain all the knowledge and experience by keeping an open mind and tackling any challenge I'm faced with. I'm open to collaboration with teammates to solve complex problems that may seem difficult at first glance. With my current skillset, I want to be a software engineer that works on client software for browsers and desktops. As the school year progresses, I hope to strengthen my coding coding skills, specifically in C++, and continue to enjoy working on projects for school and in my free time.</p>
